# Plover JSON Dictionary Matcher

This tool helps you identify common entries between two Plover JSON dictionary files. Whether you're merging dictionaries or looking to find overlapping strokes and definitions between different sources, this matcher makes it easy. You can either input a URL to a JSON file or upload the files directly. After identifying the common entries, the tool will allow you to download the matched entries as a new JSON file.

## How do I open this?

Download the `index.html` file and open it in your browser of choice.

## How It Works

1. First, choose whether to input a URL or upload a JSON file from your device.
2. If using a URL, paste the link to your JSON file. If uploading, select the first JSON file.
3. Upload the second JSON file that you want to match against the first.
4. The tool will compare the two files and find the common entries.

> **Note:** Only the entries from the second dictionary uploaded in step 3 will be included in the result. This means you'll receive a new JSON file containing only the matching entries from the second dictionary, which overlapped with entries in the first dictionary.
